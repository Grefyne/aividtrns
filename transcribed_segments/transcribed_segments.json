And it's kind of like London, the city of London. That's our one big like tech hub. And so finance is an exciting space where, you know, you've got all these really smart mathematicians, physicists, who take all these techniques on how to model stuff, how to predict things, and they apply it to financial assets. And so it was very natural when, you know, all my peers were going into places like Jane Street or going into places like Citadel. You know, even I studied to like pass some round one interviews at a couple hedge funds and algorithmic trading firms. So it's really that was just the direction that people in the UK work towards. Very much like people on the West Coast. They all have in their mind they want to do a tech startup or be involved in tech in somehow. That's kind of the culture which I was surrounded by in the UK at the time when I graduated.",
